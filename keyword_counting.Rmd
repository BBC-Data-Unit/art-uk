This is based on steps outlined in a [blog post by John Victor Anderson](http://johnvictoranderson.org/?p=115). 

First, we need to export the column of keywords:

```{r}
bbcartfull <- read.csv("artdata.csv", header=FALSE)
#The keywords are in the 16th column, called V16 because there were no column headers
write.csv(bbcartfull$V16, 'keywordsastext.txt')
```

Now we re-import that data as a character object using `scan`:

```{r}
keywords <- scan('keywordsastext.txt', what="char", sep=",")
# We convert all text to lower case to prevent any case sensitive issues with counting
keywords <- tolower(keywords)
```

We now need to put this through a series of conversions before we can generate a table:

```{r}
keywords.split <- strsplit(keywords, " ")
keywordsvec <- unlist(keywords.split)
keywordstable <- table(keywordsvec)
```

That table is enough to create a CSV from:

```{r}
write.csv(keywordstable1, 'keywordcount.csv')
```
